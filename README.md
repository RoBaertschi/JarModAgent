# JarModAgent

java agent for bootstrapping jar mods, as well as coremodding
with [ClassTransform](https://github.com/Lenni0451/ClassTransform) for runtime patches.

## TODO

* support class transform better in unimined - add remapping support (maybe fork and do refmaps)

* bootstrap jars from the mods folder

* read transform list from manifest instead of launch arg
